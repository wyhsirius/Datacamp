chemotherapy: using chemical substances(chemotherapeutic agents) to kill cells which divide too quickly

goal: 
1. to prevent wrong medication
2. to check that they contain the good chemotherapeutic agent with the good dosage.(检查药物里是否具有正确的chemotherapeutic agents，以及是否具有正确的剂量)

Raman spectroscopy(拉曼光谱学)
1. each molecule has a specific spectral fingerprint by which the molecule can be identified
2. the Raman intensity increases with the concentration of the molecule
advantage of spectroscopy above other methods: non-destructive, non-invasive

goal of the project: 
to develop prediction models able to 

1. identify
2. quantify 

chemotherapeutic agents from Raman spectra 


4 types of chemotherapeutic agents (molecule)
in
3 different packages (vial)
diluted in
9 different solutions (solute gammes)
having different concentrations (浓度)

two objects:
classification: predict which molecule it corresponds to given the spectrum
regression: predict the concentration of a molecule. The predition should not depend on the vial or the solute group
